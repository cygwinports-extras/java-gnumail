ldesc: "GNU JavaMail provides a protocol-independent framework for 
building mail client applications in Java. The API itself provides a 
complete MIME implementation, and drivers for individual messaging 
protocols, known as providers, can be plugged into the JavaMail 
framework dynamically. Several providers, implementing Internet standard 
protocols, are included with GNU JavaMail."
